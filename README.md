# Unity-Game
A 2D adventure game I created on my own time.

I decided I would learn unity and C# by building a simple 2D game. I will not upload the actual game to github until it is fully finished. In the mean time however I will post my C# code here.

The game can be played here  http://skilleen.com/portfolio.html
